## Application Value

```
Due to COVID19 pandemic, travel was limited for the past year. Now that the pandemic is almost over and travel bans are being uplifted, more residents will seek travel opportunities in the United States. Whenever someone travels, planning a trip out is the most time-consuming part. This Travel App was created to reduce the amount of time it takes a user to plan out a trip.
